## About the Project  
**Duration:** September 01, 2023 – December 22, 2023  

Drive4U is a **smart driver-care solution** built using IMU sensor data to evaluate risky driving behaviors and provide personalized driving insights.  
The project also includes an **integrated fleet management system** for rental car companies, improving efficiency in vehicle monitoring and customer management.  

The system encourages safe driving by visualizing risky driving habits, lowering vehicle maintenance costs, and enhancing customer service efficiency for rental companies.

## Key Features  

- **Driving Habit Analysis**  
  Real-time collection of driving and environmental data via sensors, with analysis of overall driving patterns.  

- **Risky Driving Detection**  
  Algorithms detect sudden acceleration, sudden braking, and zigzag driving.  

- **MyData Solution**  
  A personalized dashboard that visualizes driving habits and provides tailored feedback to each driver.  

- **Integrated Control System**  
  A central dashboard for rental companies to manage vehicles and customer data effectively.  

- **Safe Driving Reward System**  
  Encourages competition between drivers, offering differentiated rental fees based on safe driving levels.

1. **Data Collection:** Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense collects real-time driving and environmental data and sends it to a web server via WiFi.  
2. **Risk Detection:** Algorithms process the incoming data to detect risky driving and save results in a database.  
3. **Driver Score Update:** Results update each driver’s score and safety level, adjusting rental fees accordingly.  
4. **WISE-PaaS Dashboard:** Integrates with MySQL to visualize data for both drivers and rental companies.
